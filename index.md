Hi, welcome to my personal page! My name is Pedro Bernardinelli. I am a DiRAC postdoctoral fellow at the [DiRAC Institute](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu/person/pedro-bernardinelli/) and an eScience fellow at the [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/people/pedro-bernardinelli/) at the University of Washington. Before joining UW, I completed my PhD in physics & astronomy at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/graduate-students/pedro-henrique-bernardinelli) (PA - USA; Aug 2016 - May 2021) with professors [Gary Bernstein](http://www.physics.upenn.edu/~garyb/) and [Masao Sako](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/masao-sako), and my undergraduate studies at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (SP - Brazil, Jan 2012 - Dec 2015). 

My main research focus is on the discovery, characterization, and statistical studies of the minor bodies in the outer Solar System in large astronomical surveys. An overview of my research projects and highlights can be found [here](./index01-research.md).
