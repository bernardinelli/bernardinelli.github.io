Hi, welcome to my personal page! I expect you to have at least some idea of who I am (otherwise, how did you get here in the first place?!?), but let me introduce myself anyway. 

My name is Pedro Bernardinelli. I am a PhD candidate in physics & astronomy at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/graduate-students/pedro-henrique-bernardinelli) (PA - USA; Aug 2016-), working on solar system astrophysics with professors [Gary Bernstein](http://www.physics.upenn.edu/~garyb/) and [Masao Sako](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/masao-sako), as a member of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org). 

I graduated from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/pt-br/users/bernardi) (SP - Brazil; Jan 2012-Dec 2015) and worked with prof. [Raul Abramo](http://fma.if.usp.br/~abramo/) in supernovae Ia cosmology during my final 3 years, taking part in the both the [J-PAS](http://j-pas.org/ "Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey") and [S-PLUS](http://www.iag.usp.br/labcosmos/en/s-plus/ "Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey") collaborations. 

You can find me online in many places. Besides here, I also am on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0743-9422
 "Orcid ID"), on [Github](https://github.com/bernardinelli "Pedro Bernardinelli"), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phbernardinelli), when I remember that it exists, on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Pedro-Henrique-Bernardinelli "Pedro Bernardinelli"), writing whenever possible, and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pedrohbernardinelli/) and Facebook, but you may not want those.
