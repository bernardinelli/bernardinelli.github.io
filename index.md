Hi, welcome to my personal page! I expect you to have at least some idea of who I am (otherwise, how did you get here in the first place?!?), but let me introduce myself anyway. 

My name is Pedro Bernardinelli. I am a PhD student in physics & astronomy at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/graduate-students/pedro-henrique-bernardinelli) (PA - USA; Aug 2016-), working on solar system astrophysics with professors Gary Bernstein and Masao Sako. I graduated from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/pt-br/users/bernardi) (SP - Brazil; Jan 2012-Dec 2015) and worked with prof. Raul Abramo in supernovae Ia cosmology during my last 3 years, taking part in the both the [J-PAS](http://j-pas.org/ "Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey") and [S-PLUS](http://www.iag.usp.br/labcosmos/en/s-plus/ "Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey") collaborations. 

You can find me online in many places. Besides here, I also am on [Github](https://github.com/bernardinelli "Pedro Bernardinelli"), where I share some of my codes, on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Pedro-Henrique-Bernardinelli "Pedro Bernardinelli"), writing whenever possible, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phbernardinelli), when I remember that it exists, and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pedrohbernardinelli/) and Facebook, but you may not want those. I have profiles elsewhere, too, but these are the most important.

My academic e-mails are <pedrobe@sas.upenn.edu> or <bernardi@if.usp.br>. If you want to contact me about other things, please e-mail me at <pedro@bernardinelli.org>. I have a huge number of other e-mail addresses, but let's focus on these three for now!
