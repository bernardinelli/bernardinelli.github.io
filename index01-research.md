### PhD ###
I'm currently working on identifying trans-Neptunian objects in the Dark Energy Survey. These planetesimals are distant objects in the outskirts of our Solar System, tracing its formation history. As DES is not a dedicated solar system survey, this process is very challenging: we need to identify single-night transients (i.e. detections that only appear in the same place in one night) and link together detections forming orbits (find multiple detections of a given orbit). This is a very computationally expensive process (requiring over one million CPU-hours), but feasible nonetheless. Stay tuned for the results of our analysis with the first four years of DES data!

Inside DES, I also worked with the characterization of the atmospheric turbulence correlation for DECam exposures in order to better understand astrometric errors on our images. Besides that, I conducted a careful study on the detection efficiency in the DES pipeline, leading to a significant improvement in the recovery efficiency and completeness of DES exposures.

### Undergraduate ###
During my undergraduate years, I worked with prof. Raul Abramo with cosmological applications of supernovae Ia. Our main goal was to develop an observational strategy for the S-PLUS variability/SNe survey. I also worked with measurements of the atmospheric extinction coefficient using all-sky images inside the S-PLUS collaboration.
