### PhD ###
I'm currently working on identifying trans-Neptunian objects in the Dark Energy Survey. These planetesimals are distant objects in the outskirts of our Solar System, tracing the formation history of the giant planets. As DES is not a solar system survey, this process is very challenging: we need to identify single-night transients (i.e. things that only appear in one place in one night) and link together detections forming orbits. 

### Undergraduate ###
During my undergraduate years, I worked with prof. Raul Abramo with cosmological applications of supernovae Ia. Our main goal was to develop an observational strategy for the S-PLUS variability/SNe survey. 

### Other ###
Inside DES, I worked with computing the atmospheric turbulence correlation for DECam exposures in order to better characterize astrometric errors on this instrument. Besides that, I conducted a careful study on the detection efficiency in the DES pipeline, leading to an improvement in the completeness of DES exposures.

I also worked with measurements of the atmospheric extinction coefficient using all-sky images inside the S-PLUS collaboration.
