### PhD ###
Coming soon!

### Undergraduate ###
During my undergraduate years, I worked with prof. Raul Abramo with cosmological applications of supernovae Ia. Our main goal was to develop an observational strategy for the S-PLUS variability/SNe survey. Our method consisted in using an approximation to a Fisher matrix regarding cosmological parameters for the survey simulations and searching for ways to maximize both this value and the quality of the measurements given our observational constraints. This method was also applied to the J-PAS supernovae survey.  

### Other ###
I also worked with some people from the S-PLUS collaboration in measurements of the atmospheric extinction coefficient using all-sky images.
