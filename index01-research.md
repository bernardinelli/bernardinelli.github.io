### PhD ###
I'm currently working on identifying transient objects in the Dark Energy Survey. The focus of the project is on finding and characterizing trans-neptunian objects, which are distant objects in our Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune and even Pluto. 

### Undergraduate ###
During my undergraduate years, I worked with prof. Raul Abramo with cosmological applications of supernovae Ia. Our main goal was to develop an observational strategy for the S-PLUS variability/SNe survey. 

### Other ###
I also worked with some people from the S-PLUS collaboration in measurements of the atmospheric extinction coefficient using all-sky images.
